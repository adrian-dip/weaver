# Weaver: A Modular and Extensible Data Integration Framework

Weaver is an open-source Python framework designed to simplify and streamline data integration tasks. It provides a flexible and modular architecture that allows you to easily connect to various data sources, execute queries, and process data using a powerful data pipeline.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Weaver follows a modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes extensibility. The main components include Yarns (data retrieval), Fabric (database and API integration), Loom (data flow orchestration), Shuttle (messaging and caching), and Pattern (configuration and templating).

- **Multiple Data Source Support**: Weaver supports a wide range of data sources, including SQL databases, NoSQL databases, vector databases, and APIs. It provides a consistent interface to interact with these data sources, making it easy to query and retrieve data.

- **Flexible Data Pipeline**: Weaver allows you to define and execute data pipelines using a declarative configuration. The Loom component orchestrates the data flow, enabling you to perform complex data transformations, aggregations, and processing tasks.

- **Concurrent and Parallel Execution**: Weaver supports both sequential and parallel execution of data pipelines. The ParallelLoom implementation utilizes a thread pool to execute pipeline steps concurrently, improving performance and efficiency.

- **Caching and Messaging**: The Shuttle component provides caching and messaging capabilities to optimize data retrieval and enable communication between different stages of the data pipeline. It helps in reducing redundant computations and facilitates efficient data flow.

- **Extensible and Customizable**: Weaver is designed to be highly extensible and customizable. You can easily add new data sources, implement custom Yarns and Fabrics, and extend the framework to fit your specific data integration requirements.

- **Configuration and Templating**: Weaver uses the Pattern component for configuration management and templating. It allows you to define reusable templates for queries and data processing tasks, making it easier to maintain and modify the data pipeline.
